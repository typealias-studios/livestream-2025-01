# TypeAlias Show Livestream #5 - January 29, 2025

Watch the show here - https://typea.li/as/live05

If you've hesitated to use ArrowKt because, like me, you don't consider yourself a Functional Programming developer, it's a great time to give this set of libraries another look!
Join me (and a special guest!) on Wednesday, January 29 at our usual time, 10 AM CST, when we'll explore some outstanding features in the ArrowKt library that any Kotlin developer can benefit from. 

While you're here, join the chat - say hello, ask questions, and hang out with me and other enthusiastic Kotlin developers like yourself!
